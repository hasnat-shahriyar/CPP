C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs as an enhancement of the C language. C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means it supports concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

Here are some key differences between C and C++:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** C++ supports OOP features such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, which are not present in C.

2. **Classes and Objects:** C++ allows the definition of classes, which are user-defined data types. Objects are instances of these classes, allowing for better organization and encapsulation of data and functionality.

3. **Inheritance:** C++ supports inheritance, allowing one class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (base class or superclass).

4. **Polymorphism:** C++ supports polymorphism, which means that objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling functions to operate on objects of different types through function overloading and virtual functions.

5. **Function Overloading:** C++ allows functions to have the same name but with different parameter lists, which is not directly supported in C.

6. **References:** C++ introduces the concept of references, which are aliases to existing variables. References provide an alternative to pointers with some safety benefits.

7. **Templates:** C++ introduces templates, which allow generic programming. Templates enable the creation of functions and classes that operate with generic types, providing greater code reusability and flexibility.

8. **Standard Template Library (STL):** C++ comes with a rich set of libraries known as the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides many commonly used data structures and algorithms.

9. **Namespace:** C++ introduces the concept of namespaces, which allow organizing code into logical groups and help in preventing name conflicts.

While C++ extends and enhances C, it still maintains compatibility with C code. C++ compilers can compile most C code with minor modifications. However, C++ introduces new features and paradigms that make it a more powerful and versatile language for software development, especially for large-scale projects requiring OOP principles and modern programming techniques.
