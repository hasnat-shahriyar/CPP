Let's break down the concepts of class, `this` keyword, pointer, address, heap memory, `new` keyword, and `delete` keyword with the given code example:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Person
{
public:
    string name;
    int age;
    Person(string name, int age)
    {
        this->name = name;
        this->age = age;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Person *rakib = new Person("Rakib", 25);
    Person *mehedi = new Person("Mehedi", 24);
    *rakib = *mehedi;
    delete mehedi;
    cout << rakib->name << rakib->age << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Class

A class in C++ is a user-defined type that serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It can contain data members (variables) and member functions (methods) to operate on the data.

In the given code:

```cpp
class Person
{
public:
    string name;
    int age;
    Person(string name, int age)
    {
        this->name = name;
        this->age = age;
    }
};
```

`Person` is a class with two data members (`name` and `age`) and a constructor to initialize these members.

### this Keyword

The `this` keyword in C++ is a pointer to the current object instance of the class. It is used within a class to refer to the object itself.

In the constructor:

```cpp
Person(string name, int age)
{
    this->name = name;
    this->age = age;
}
```

`this->name` refers to the `name` member of the current `Person` object, distinguishing it from the constructor parameter `name`.

### Pointer

A pointer in C++ is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

In the `main` function:

```cpp
Person *rakib = new Person("Rakib", 25);
Person *mehedi = new Person("Mehedi", 24);
```

`rakib` and `mehedi` are pointers to `Person` objects.

### Address

An address in C++ refers to a specific location in memory where a variable is stored. Pointers hold these addresses.

For example, `rakib` holds the address of the `Person` object created with `new Person("Rakib", 25)`.

### Heap Memory

Heap memory is a region of memory used for dynamic allocation. Variables allocated on the heap are managed by the programmer and remain allocated until explicitly deallocated.

In the code:

```cpp
Person *rakib = new Person("Rakib", 25);
Person *mehedi = new Person("Mehedi", 24);
```

`new` allocates memory on the heap for `Person` objects and returns a pointer to this memory.

### new Keyword

The `new` keyword in C++ dynamically allocates memory on the heap for an object or array and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.

```cpp
Person *rakib = new Person("Rakib", 25);
```

This creates a `Person` object on the heap and returns a pointer to it, which is stored in `rakib`.

### delete Keyword

The `delete` keyword in C++ deallocates memory that was previously allocated with `new`.

```cpp
delete mehedi;
```

This deallocates the memory allocated for the `Person` object pointed to by `mehedi`.

### Example Explained

1. **Creating Objects on the Heap:**

   ```cpp
   Person *rakib = new Person("Rakib", 25);
   Person *mehedi = new Person("Mehedi", 24);
   ```

   Two `Person` objects are created on the heap, and their addresses are stored in `rakib` and `mehedi`.

2. **Object Copy:**

   ```cpp
   *rakib = *mehedi;
   ```

   This line copies the contents (name and age) of the `Person` object pointed to by `mehedi` into the object pointed to by `rakib`. After this operation, `rakib` and `mehedi` have the same `name` and `age` values.

3. **Deleting an Object:**

   ```cpp
   delete mehedi;
   ```

   The `Person` object pointed to by `mehedi` is deallocated from the heap.

4. **Output:**
   ```cpp
   cout << rakib->name << rakib->age << endl;
   ```
   This prints the `name` and `age` of the `Person` object pointed to by `rakib`. Since `rakib` was copied from `mehedi`, it outputs "Mehedi24".

In summary, this code demonstrates the creation and manipulation of objects on the heap using pointers, the `this` keyword to refer to the current object instance, and the `new` and `delete` keywords for dynamic memory management.
